Domesticated maize and wild teosinte differ in their amount of lateral branching. The selection for upright plants as apposed to bushy plants was important for the domestication of maize. Teosinte branched 1 (Tb1) is a gene that controls branching in both teosinte and maize and higher levels of expression of tb1 leads to apical dominance in maize. This increase in expression is caused by a LTR retrotransposon insertion when inserted into regulatory regions near tb1. Increasing the copy number of Hopscotch in the maize genome could have no effect on branching; however, if there are numerous Hopscotch insertions, the host genome can increase silencing of Hopscotch and this could downregulate tb1. By implementing computational tools and software on existing resequencing data of individuals across a range of inbred teosinte lines, my research project could determine the location and copy number of Hopscotch insertions across individuals and populations, and if variation exists, how it impacts gene expression and phenotype.
