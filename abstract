[major diff between maize and teosinte is apical dominance, and selection for upright plants as opposed to bushy relative teosinte was important for domestication] Teosinte branched 1 (Tb1) is a gene that controls branching in both teosinte and maize, and . Hhigher levels of expression Tb1 is a gene that controls branching in both teosinte and maize. Higher levels of expression of tb1 results in apical dominance in maize. The LTR retrotransposon Hopscotch upregulates tb1 when inserted into regulatory regions so it is expected that a very high copy number of Hopscotch in the maize genome should mean minimal branching; however, if there are numerous Hopscotch insertions, the host genome can increase silencing of Hopscotch and this would downregulate tb1. My research project aims to determine the location and copy number of Hopscotch insertions across individuals and populations and if variation exists, how it impacts gene expression and phenotype.of tb1 results in apical dominance in maize.
